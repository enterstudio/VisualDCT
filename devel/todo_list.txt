critical, probably easy:
-name changes in spreadsheet should rename links

possibly annoying, easy:
-persistence of the selected tab in spreadsheet view
-multiple rows/columns hidding

critical, difficult:
-changes of the number of objects by undo/redo should be reflected in spreadsheet 

rare or possibly unimportant, easy:
-inspector has to refresh on field change in spreadsheet
-inspector has to refresh link fields on rename in main window
-spreadsheet column resize on changed field
-window unfocus, focus on rename dialog should not overwrite the name with the current
-in the main vdct workspace the grid should be displayed to the exact bottom and right edge
-preservation of unrecognised view comment data for future versions

future development:
-nonmodal spreadsheet view - make an event based refreshing for it
-generalize inspector interface for both inspector and spreadsheetinspector
