critical, medium difficulty:
-support for adding macros to templates in spreadsheet view

possibly annoying, easy:
-persistence of the selected tab in spreadsheet view

rare or possibly unimportant, easy:
-inspector has to refresh on field change in spreadsheet
-inspector has to refresh link fields on rename in main window
-spreadsheet column resize on changed field
-window unfocus, focus on rename dialog should not overwrite the name with the current
-in the main vdct workspace the grid should be displayed to the exact bottom and right edge
-preservation of unrecognised view comment data for future versions
-spreadsheet popup selection commands only when clicking over selections
-deleting instances in spreadsheet using delete key
-detecting all hidden/shown row states for apreadsheet row popup command selection

future development:
-new tab in spreadsheet view for all records/templates
-column display mode in spreadsheet that shows only column when an instance has a field with nondefault value
-nonmodal spreadsheet view - make an event based refreshing for it
-generalize inspector interface for both inspector and spreadsheetinspector
-faster version of spreadsheet view refresh when multiple instances are added/removed
