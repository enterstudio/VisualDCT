#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Configuration file for ViewCVS
#
# Information on ViewCVS is located at the following web site:
#     http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# BASIC CONFIGURATION
#
# For correct operation, you will probably need to change the following
# configuration variables:
#
#    cvs_roots
#    default_root
#    rcs_path
#    mime_types_file
#
# It is usually desirable to change the following variables:
#
#    address
#    main_title
#    logo
#    forbidden
#
#    long_intro
#    repository_info
#
#    use_enscript
#
# For Python source colorization:
#
#    py2html_path
#
# If your icons are in a special location:
#
#    icons
#

#
# FORMAT INFORMATION
#
# This file is delineated by sections, specified in [brackets]. Within each
# section, are a number of configuration settings. These settings take the
# form of: name = value. Values may be continued on the following line by
# indenting the continued line.
#
# WARNING: indentation *always* means continuation. name=value lines should
#          always start in column zero.
#
# Comments should always start in column zero, and are identified with "#".
#
# Certain configuration settings may have multiple values. These should be
# separated by a comma. The settings where this is allowed are noted below.
#
# Any other setting that requires special syntax is noted at that setting.
# 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[general]

#
# This setting specifies each of the CVS roots on your system and assigns
# names to them. Each root should be given by a "name: path" value. Multiple
# roots should be separated by commas.
#
cvs_roots =
	VisualDCT : /home/cvs/

# this is the name of the default CVS root.
default_root = VisualDCT

# uncomment if the RCS binaries are not on the standard path
# NOTE: the trailing slash is required!
#rcs_path = /usr/bin/

#
# This is a pathname to a MIME types file to help viewcvs to guess the
# correct MIME type on checkout.
#
# If you are having problems with the default guess on the MIME type, then
# uncomment this option and point it at a MIME type file.
#
# For example, you can use the mime.types from apache here:
#mime_types_file = /usr/local/apache/conf/mime.types

# This address is shown in the footer. It should contain the CVS maintainer.
address = <a href="mailto:matej.sekoranja@ijs.si">matej.sekoranja@ijs.si</a>

# this title is used on the main entry page
main_title = Visual DCT CVS Repository

#
# This should contain a list of modules in the repository that should not be
# displayed (by default or by explicit path specification).
#
# This configuration can be a simple list of modules, or it can get quite
# complex:
#
#   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it
#      is NOT forbidden. Whenever this form is seen, then all modules will
#      be forbidden unless one of the "!" modules match.
#
#   *) Shell-style "glob" expressions may be used. "*" will match any
#      sequence of zero or more characters, "?" will match any single
#      character, "[seq]" will match any character in seq, and "[!seq]"
#      will match any character not in seq.
#
#   *) Tests are performed in sequence. The first match will terminate the
#      testing. This allows for more complex allow/deny patterns.
#
# Tests are case-sensitive.
#
forbidden = !VisualDCT

# Some examples:
#
# Disallow "example" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example
#
# Disallow "example1" and "example2" but allow all others:
#   forbidden = example1, example2
#
# Allow *only* "example1" and "example2":
#   forbidden = !example1, !example2
#
# Forbid modules starting with "x":
#   forbidden = x*
#
# Allow modules starting with "x" but no others:
#   forbidden = !x*
#
# Allow "xml", forbid other modules starting with "x", and allow the rest:
#   forbidden = !xml, x*, !*

    <p>
    This is a WWW interface for VisualDCT CVS Repositories.
    You can browse the file hierarchy by picking directories
    (which have slashes after them, <i>e.g.</i>, <b>src/</b>).
    If you pick a file, you will see the revision history
    for that file.
    Selecting a revision number will download that revision of
    the file.  There is a link at each revision to display
    diffs between that revision and the previous one, and
    a form at the bottom of the page that allows you to
    display diffs between arbitrary revisions.
